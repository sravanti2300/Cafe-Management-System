## Introduction

The Cafe Management System is a Java-based application designed to streamline and automate the operations of a cafe. The system consists of three main modules: item management, cashier operations, and auditing. Users can manage the cafe's menu, process customer orders, and maintain a detailed audit log of transactions.

## Features

### 1. Item Management
- **Add Items:** Users can add new items to the cafe menu, specifying details such as item name, price, and category.
- **Edit Items:** Allows for the modification of existing item details, such as price or category.
- **Delete Items:** Users can remove items that are no longer part of the cafe's offerings.

### 2. Cashier Operations
- **Order Processing:** Cashiers can select items and input the quantity for each item in a customer's order.
- **Total Bill Calculation:** The system calculates the total bill based on the items and quantities entered.
- **Print Option:** Cashiers can print the final bill, including the total amount due.

### 3. Auditing
- **User and Transaction Logging:** The system logs user activities and transaction details, including timestamps.
- **Downloadable Audit Reports:** A detailed audit report can be downloaded, providing insights into the cafe's operations.

### 4. Authentication
- **Sign In/Sign Out:** Users can securely sign in and out of the system, ensuring data security and user accountability.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The core programming language for building the application logic.
- **MySQL:** Used for database management to store and retrieve data.
- **JavaFX:** Employed for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Maven:** Dependency management and project build tool.

## Application Setup/ How to run

1. **Database Setup:**
    - Create a MySQL database and import the provided schema.
    - Update the `constants.java` file with the appropriate database connection details.

2. **Java Development Kit (JDK):**
    - Ensure you have a compatible JDK installed (e.g., JDK 8 or later).

3. **Maven:**
    - Install Maven on your system.
    - Open the project as Maven Project in Netbeans
    - Build the project using the `mvn clean install` command.

 
4. **Add MySQL Connector to Maven:**
   - Open your project's `pom.xml` file.
   - Add the MySQL Connector and DbUtils dependencies:

     ```xml
     <dependencies>
         <!-- MySQL Connector -->
         <dependency>
             <groupId>mysql</groupId>
             <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
             <version>8.0.23</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
         </dependency>

         <!-- DbUtils -->
         <dependency>
             <groupId>net.sourceforge.dbutils</groupId>
             <artifactId>commons-dbutils</artifactId>
             <version>1.7</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
         </dependency>
     </dependencies>
     ```

5. **Download DbUtils Package:**
   - Download `res2xml.jar` from SourceForge [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/res2xml/).
   - Add `res2xml.jar` to your project.

6. **Create MySQL Database:**
   - Open your MySQL client.
   - Execute the following SQL commands:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS cafeDb;
     USE cafeDb;

     CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ProductTbl (
         Pnum INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
         Pname VARCHAR(255),
         Category VARCHAR(40),
         Price INT
     );

     CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS BillTbl (
         Bnum INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
         Seller VARCHAR(30),
         BDate VARCHAR(30),
         Amount INT
     );
     ```
7. **Run the Application:**
    - Execute the generated JAR file or run the application from the IDE.

## Usage

1. **Item Management:**
    - Navigate to the "Items" page to add, edit, or delete items from the cafe menu.

2. **Cashier Operations:**
    - Access the "Cashier" page to process customer orders, calculate the total bill, and print the final bill.

3. **Auditing:**
    - Explore the "Auditing" page to view user activities and transaction logs. Download audit reports for detailed analysis.

4. **Authentication:**
    - Use the sign-in and sign-out functionality to secure access to the system.
